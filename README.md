# Intro to Bow

This repository is a Swift playground presenting an introduction about [Bow](https://github.com/bow-swift/bow), a library for Functional Programming in Swift. In order to link the playground with the Bow framework, a workspace needed to be created. To be able to run it, you need to clone this project, open `IntroToBow.xcworkspace` and build it. This will build the dependencies (different pods for the Bow modules that we are using in the introduction), and then you will be able to run the playground.
